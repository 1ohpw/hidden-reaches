<i>The Bay Area is a beautiful place, and the premiere location for those chasing their tech dreams. However the expensive costs here limit opportunity for many, who struggle to find an affordable place to live. Popular housing sites and apps are scattered, riddled with scams & unreasonable prices, as well as a confusing user experience. [Hidden Reaches](https://hidden-reaches-36395.herokuapp.com/) is here to simplify your housing needs. The simple interface makes it easy to find inexpensive rentals, or to post openings you have available.</i>

##Technologies
